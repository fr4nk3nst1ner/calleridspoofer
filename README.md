This is a sample Dial Plan configuration to setup within Asterisk. The purpose is to configure the caller ID spoofer as well as recording functionality. 

In this configuration, pressing 1 will simply dial the number. Pressing 2 will record the phone call. Pressing 3 is still a work in progress but will eventually allow for changes in pitch of voice during live calls.
